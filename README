CapyPi is a cool, interactive capybara toy that chats, moves, and learns from hanging out with you. Just pick it up to wake it up, and it'll snooze off when it's left alone for a bit.

It's powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B and comes to life with a shock sensor, a USB mic, a Bluetooth speaker, a servo motor, and the smarts of GPT-3.5, all stitched together with some Python magic. Setting it up is pretty simple: once you've got all the parts, just kick things off by running:

1. connect the raspeberry pi with the usb microphone and speaker. 
2. checkout this repo
3. set up the env: 
export OPENAI_API_KEY='you open ai key'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='you id'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your secret'
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='xxx'
export BROWSER=chromium-browser
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY='your key'
source /home/pi/capytoy/dev/bin/activate
4. nohup python shocktrigger.py &

How to interact: 

Capy doesn't need much to take a break—just stop chatting, and it'll drift off to sleep. Or, you can say "Stop Stop," "Exit,", "さようなら", "adiós" or "再见" to tell it you're done for now. It can chat like the regular chatgpt and it can get real time weather and time.  

If capy went to sleep, you can pick her up or shake her to wake her up if you have the shock sensor. 

Right now, Capy can only move its mouth when it talks, but we've got plans to give it more moves by adding extra servos so it can wander around.

I used GPT to help me code and find out how to work with raspeberry pi.



To run the program without the shock sensor:
python capy.py

to generate any mp3 files for greetings, exit and any others:
python genvoicefile.py


To do:
1. add lights flashing while waiting
2. add gesture with servo while starting, talking, waiting. : waving, knoding, winking, mouthing etc.
